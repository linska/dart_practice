// A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is
// currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than
// or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
// Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach
// its target.

// For example, given:
//   x = 10
//   y = 85
//   d = 30
// the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

// after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
// after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
// after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100

void main() {
  int x = 10;
  int y = 85;
  int d = 30;
  final int distance = y - x;
  final double jumps = distance / d;

  print(jumps.ceil());
}
